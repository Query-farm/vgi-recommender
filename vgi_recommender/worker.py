"""VGI worker exposing collaborative-filtering recommendations to DuckDB/SQL.

Assembles the recommender table functions in ``vgi_recommender`` into a single
``recommender`` catalog and provides the process entry point. The repo-root
``recommender_worker.py`` is a thin shim over this module for ``uv run``;
installed users get the ``vgi-recommender`` console script, which calls ``main``
here.

    ATTACH 'recommender' (TYPE vgi, LOCATION 'uv run recommender_worker.py');
    SELECT * FROM recommender.recommend_all((SELECT u, i, v FROM events),
        user := 'u', item := 'i', value := 'v', n := 10);
